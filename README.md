O(√n) Program to find is a number is prime

To check if a number is prime, it is only necessary to check up to that number's square root. 
This is because if we have a number n, its square factors m * m, then factors a * b, if 'a' is less than m, then b is greater than m. Therefore, time complexity is O(√n).
